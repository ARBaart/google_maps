This is a fork of the library which uses async and non-blocking calls.
The examples below need to be updated, by adding `.await` after `execute()`,
and the call need to be made in an `async` function. The API should be 
otherwise similar. (Except the rate limit has been turned off by default)


ðŸ—º An unofficial Google Maps Platform client library for the Rust programming
language. This client currently implements the Directions API, Distance Matrix
API, Elevation API, Geocoding API, and Time Zone API.

# Welcome

This crate is expected to work well and have the more important Google Maps
features implemented. It should work well because Reqwest and Serde do most of
the heavy lifting! While it's an early release, this crate should work fine as
is for most people.

I created this client library because I needed several Google Maps Platform
features for a project that I'm working on. So, I've decided to spin my library
off into a public crate. This is a very small token of gratitude and an attempt
to give back to the Rust community. I hope it saves someone out there some work.

# Before You Begin

* In your project's `Cargo.toml` file, under the `[dependencies]` section:

	* Add `google_maps = "1.0.0"`. Check
		[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/google_maps) for the latest
		version number.

	* Add `rust_decimal = "1.5.0"`. Check
		[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) for the
		latest version number.

* The full documentation is available at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/google_maps/)

# What's new?

* 1.0.0: 2020-05-16: Inteface stable.

* 0.7.3: 2020-04-25: For the Distance-Matrix API, some response fields that
should have been public weren't. Fixed.

* 0.7.2: 2020-04-21: Small bug fixes. Also, some logging was causing stack
overflows, so it had to be disabled.

* 0.7.1: 2020-03-10: Added in as many derivable traits as possible. Changed
transit fare amount from `f64` to `rust_decimal::Decimal`. Clean-ups as
commanded by Clippy.

* 0.7.1: 2020-03-10: For Time Zone API requests from this crate has moved from
expressing the time in `chrono::NaiveDateTime` to `chrono::DateTime<Utc>`. See
the updated time zone example.

* 0.7.0: 2020-03-08: Transitioned from `f64` to `rust_decimal::Decimal` for
latitude and longitude coordinates. This eliminates rounding errors. The
`Decimal` type is also hashable. Nice. `LatLng`, `Waypoint`, `Location` types
can now be used as keys for hash maps. **To define a `Decimal` value in your
code, currently you must add the `rust_decimal` dependency into your
`Cargo.toml` file**. Use the `dec!()` macro like so: `dec!(12.345)`. This is the
preferred way to define latitude and longitude coordinates. If you do not want
to add this line to your `Cargo.toml` file, you may also create a `Decimal` from
a `&str` like so: `Decimal::from_str("12.345").unwrap()`. See the new examples.
Also, see the [rust_decimal crate](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal) for
more information.

* 0.7.0: 2020-03-08: To better align this crate with Rust conventions, I've
converted many `String` parameters to `&str` parameters. If you're receiving new
compilations errors like `the trait bound google_maps::directions::response::
driving_maneuver::DrivingManeuver: std::convert::From<std::string::String> is
not satisfied` you will have to change your code to borrow the string. For
example, change `TransitCurrency::try_from(currency)` to
`TransitCurrency::try_from(&currency)` or to
`TransitCurrency::try_from(&*currency)` if its a `String` type.

* 0.6.0: 2020-02-29: Cleaned up the `mod` and `use` declarations. To glob import
everything from google_maps into your project, you can use the
`use google_maps::prelude::*` convention now.

* The full [change
log](https://github.com/leontoeides/google_maps/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is
available on GitHub.

let mut google_maps_client = ClientSettings::new(YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE);

// Example request:

let directions = google_maps_client.directions(
    // Origin: Canadian Museum of Nature
    Location::Address(String::from("240 McLeod St, Ottawa, ON K2P 2R1")),

        Waypoint::LatLng(LatLng::try_from(dec!(37.387_316), dec!(-122.060_008)).unwrap()),
    ],
)
.execute();

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", distance_matrix);
```

## Example Elevation API Positional Request

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;
let mut google_maps_client = ClientSettings::new(YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE);

// Example request:

let elevation = google_maps_client.elevation()
    // Denver, Colorado, the "Mile High City"
    .for_positional_request(&LatLng::try_from(dec!(39.739_154), dec!(-104.984_703)).unwrap())
    .execute();

// Parsing example:

println!("Elevation: {} meters", elevation.unwrap().results.unwrap()[0].elevation);
```

## Example Geocoding API Request

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;
let mut google_maps_client = ClientSettings::new(YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE);

// Example request:

let location = google_maps_client.geocoding()
    .with_address("10 Downing Street London")
    .execute();

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", location);

// Parsing example:

for result in &location.unwrap().results {
    println!("{}", result.geometry.location)
}
```

## Example Reverse Geocoding API Request

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;
let mut google_maps_client = ClientSettings::new(YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE);

// Example request:

let location = google_maps_client.reverse_geocoding(
    // 10 Downing St, Westminster, London
    LatLng::try_from(dec!(51.503_364), dec!(-0.127_625)).unwrap(),
)
.with_result_type(PlaceType::StreetAddress)
.execute();

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", location);

// Parsing example:

for result in &location.unwrap().results {
    for address_component in &result.address_components {
        print!("{} ", address_component.short_name);
    }
    println!(""); // New line.
}
```

## Example Time Zone API Request

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;
let mut google_maps_client = ClientSettings::new(YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE);

// Example request:

let time_zone = google_maps_client.time_zone(
     // St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, Czechia
     LatLng::try_from(dec!(50.090_903), dec!(14.400_512)).unwrap(),
     // The time right now in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
     Utc::now()
).execute().unwrap();

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", time_zone);

// Parsing example:

println!("Time at your computer: {}", Local::now().timestamp());

println!("Time in {}: {}",
    time_zone.time_zone_id.unwrap().name(),
    Utc::now().timestamp() + time_zone.dst_offset.unwrap() as i64 +
        time_zone.raw_offset.unwrap() as i64
);
```

## Example Client Settings

The Google Maps client settings can be used to change the request rate and
automatic retry parameters.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut google_maps_client = ClientSettings::new(YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE)
    // For all Google Maps Platform APIs, the client will limit 2 sucessful
    // requests for every 10 seconds:
    .with_rate(Api::All, 2, Duration::from_secs(10))
    // For unsuccessful request attempts, the client will attempt 10 retries
    // before giving up:
    .with_max_retries(10)
    // For unsuccessful requests, the delay between retries is increased after
    // each attempt. This parameter ensures that the client will not delay for
    // more than 32 seconds between retries:
    .with_max_delay(Duration::from_secs(32))
    // Returns the `ClientSettings` struct to the caller. This struct is used to
    // make Google Maps Platform requests.
    .finalize();
```

## [Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro)

Google's Geolocation API seems to be offline. While the online documentation
is still available and the API appears configurable through the Google Cloud
Platform console, the Geolocation API responds Status code `404 Not Found` with
an empty body to all requests. This API cannot be implemented until the server
responds as expected.

# Feedback

I would like for you to be successful with your project! If this crate is not
working for you, doesn't work how you think it should, or if you have requests,
or suggestions - please [report them to
me](https://github.com/leontoeides/google_maps/issues)! I'm not always fast at
responding but I will respond. Thanks!

# To do

1. Track both _requests_ and request _elements_ for rate limiting.
2. Make a generic get() function for that can be used by all APIs.
3. Considering move from `reqwest` to a lighter-weight HTTP client.
4. Look into making APIs optional, i.e. as features. Possible? Desirable?
5. Look into integrating [yaiouom](https://crates.io/crates/yaiouom).
6. Convert explicit query validation to session types wherever reasonable.
7. [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro). There
are no immediate plans for supporting this API. It's quite big and I have no
current need for it. If you would like to have to implemented, please contact
me.
8. [Roads API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/intro).
There are no immediate plans for supporting this API. It's quite big and I have
no current need for it. If you would like to have to implemented, please contact
me.
