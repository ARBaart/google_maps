/// [Languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport)
/// ====================================================================
///
/// * See the [list of supported languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport).
/// Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
/// exhaustive.
///
/// * If `language` is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred
/// language as specified in the `Accept-Language` header, or the native
/// language of the domain from which the request is sent.
///
/// * The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
/// both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses
/// in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if
/// necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are
/// returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in
/// the same language, which is chosen from the first component.
///
/// * If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
/// closest match.
///
/// * The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
/// the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
/// geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as
/// the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one
/// language but not in another. For example, _utca_ and _t√©r_ are synonyms for
/// street in Hungarian.
///
/// By default the API will attempt to load the most appropriate language based
/// on the users location or browser settings. Some APIs allow you to explicitly
/// set a language when you make a request. More information on how to set the
/// language is available in the documentation for each API:
///
/// * [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/localization)
/// * [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#language-param)
/// * [Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro#language-param)
/// * [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro#language-param)
/// * [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#language-param)
///
/// Supported Languages:
/// Google often updates supported languages. This list may not be exhaustive
/// and is subject to change.
///
/// You can see what the map will look like in any of the languages listed above
/// in this [sample application](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/demos/localization/).
